    <li><strong><br /></strong><strong> Risk awareness</strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge and confirm that you have carefully considered the risks associated with our platform and assets. The following risks associated with tokens and the Platform are not exhaustive.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1) Wallets</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wallet used in the platform is associated with certain types of tokens which are described in the Site. You confirm that:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
    <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wallet supports the type of tokens</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your external wallet. You must keep your wallet address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of tokens associated with the wallet.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><br /><br /></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2) Token transactions</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be completed, all proposed token transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the corresponding public blockchain. By using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by that public blockchain network.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once transaction details have been submitted via the Platform, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Company cannot prevent or mitigate attacks on blockchain networks and has no obligation to engage in activity in relation to such attacks. In the event of an attack, the Company reserves the right to take commercially reasonable actions, including, but not limited to, if we confirm that a network is compromised or under attack, immediately halting the platform for such network. Resolutions will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company in its sole discretion. The Company makes no representation and does not warrant the safety of the Platform and you assume all liability for any lost value or stolen property.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(4) Software protocols and operational challenges</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software protocols that underlie tokens are typically open-source projects, which means that (i) the development and control of such tokens are outside of the Company&rsquo;s control and (ii) such software protocols are subject to sudden and dramatic changes that might have a significant impact on the availability, usability or value of a given token.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The Company may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to the Platform and the Site. You understand that the Platform and the Site may experience operational issues that lead to delays. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold the Company accountable for any related losses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All users understand that the technology underlying tokens is subject to change at any time, and such changes may affect the Platform. You claim full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their consequences for your tokens. The Company does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of the Platform or your failure to understand the risks involved associated with tokens use generally or your use of our Services</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(5) Legislative and regulatory changes</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the domestic or international level may adversely affect the transfer of tokens.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(6) Other risks</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand and agree that the Company has no control over, and no duty to take any action including, but not limited to:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
    <ul>

    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mistakes made by the user of any token-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, and tokens sent to wrong addresses.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software problems of any token-related software or service, e.g., corrupted wallet file, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware affecting the wallet and/or any token-related software or service</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any token-related software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device</span></li>
