<h2><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.2. Unless otherwise specified, all terms used in this Policy shall have the same meanings as provided in Clause 1.2 Definition and Interpretation of our Terms of Use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.2. This Policy (together with our Terms of Use) explains and sets out the basis for why and when we collect Personal Information about the people who use the Platform and the Site, how we use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and the measures we take to keep it secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.4. By using the Platform and the Site, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Policy. Please note that this includes consenting to the collection and processing of any Personal Information you provide, as described below. We may amend this Policy from time to time so please check it occasionally to ensure that you agree with any changes. Your continued use of the Platform and the Site will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to, any changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.5. The Company values privacy and we make a concerted effort to minimize and, to the extent possible, eliminate the exposure of personal data during the use of our interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6. We do not collect any special categories of personal information about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.7. To the extent we collect any Personal Information, this Policy describes how the Company collects, uses, and shares Personal Information of people who use the Platform and the Site.</span></p>

By visiting the Site, and/or using the Platform, you acknowledge that the collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.9. So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; in this Policy, we mean information about an individual that (either by itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that individual to be identified, including but not limited, the individual&rsquo;s name, telephone number, or e-mail address.</span></p>
<h2><strong>2. The Blockchains</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the inherent transparency of many blockchains, transactions that individuals broadcast via any blockchain may be publicly accessible. This includes, but is not limited to, your public sending address, the public address of the receiver, the amount sent or received, and any other data a user has chosen to include in a given transaction. Information stored on a blockchain may be public, immutable, and difficult or even impossible to remove or delete. Transactions and addresses may reveal information about the user&rsquo;s identity and information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. Users are encouraged to review how privacy and transparency on the blockchain works.</span></p>
